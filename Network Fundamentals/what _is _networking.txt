# What is Networking?

-> Networks are simply things connected. For example, your friendship circle: you are all connected because of  similar interests, hobbies, skills and sorts.

   But more specifically, in computing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices. Take your phone as an example; the reason that you have it is to access things. We'll cover how these devices communicate with each other and the rules that follow.

   In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!



# What is the Internet? 

-> The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself.

   let's now imagine that Alice made some new friends named Zayn and Toby that she wants to introduce to Bob and Jim. The problem is that Alice is the only person who speaks the same language as Zayn and Toby. So Alice will have to be the messenger! Because Alice can speak both languages, they can communicate to one another through Alice â€” forming a new network.

   As previously stated, the Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together.  These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks -- or the Internet! So, to recap, a network can be one of two types:
    - A private network
    - A public network



# IP Addresses.

-> Briefly, an IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing.

   An IP address is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the network. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting.

   IP Addresses follow a set of standards known as protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and force many devices to communicate in the same language.

   A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices. 

   Public IP addresses are given by your Internet Service Provider (or ISP).



# MAC Addresses.

-> Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a MAC (Media Access Control ) address. The MAC address is a sixteen-character hexadecimal number (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated by a colon, for example, a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d. The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.

   However, an interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed" in a process known as spoofing.This spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address. When this occurs, it can often break poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy. Take the following scenario: A firewall is configured to allow any communication going to and from the MAC address of the administrator. If a device were to pretend or "spoof" this MAC address, the firewall would now think that it is receiving communication from the administrator when it isn't.



# Ping (ICMP) .

-> Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools available to us. Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable.

   The time taken for ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping. This measuring is done using ICMP's echo packet and then ICMP's echo reply from the target device.

   Pings can be performed against devices on a network, such as your home network or resources like websites. This tool can be easily used and comes installed on Operating Systems (OSs) such as Linux and Windows. The syntax to do a simple ping is ping IP address or website URL.
